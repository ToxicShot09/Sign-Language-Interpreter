# Sign Language Recognition Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a sign language recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system captures video sequences of sign language gestures and processes them to recognize specific actions. The project utilizes TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other libraries to achieve this functionality.
